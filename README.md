# Credit Risk Analysis

## What is Credit Risk Analysis?
When a customer applies for a loan, banks and other credit providers use statistical models to determine whether or not to grant the loan based on the likelihood of the loan being repaid. The factors involved in determining this likelihood are complex, and extensive statistical analysis and modeling are required to predict the outcome for each individual case. You must implement a model that predicts loan repayment or default based on the data provided.
